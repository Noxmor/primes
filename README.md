# primes
Easy and simple tool to check if numbers are prime or not.

***

## Features

* Check if a number is prime

## How to use
Just run the program and pass any numbers you want to check for primes as arguments.

If you want to check a larger range of numbers for primes, you can use the `--from` and `--to` flags. The range is always inclusive.

**Example**: `primes --from=10 --to=200` will check for primes in the range from 10 to 200 (inclusive).
